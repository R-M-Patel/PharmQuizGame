For incoming groups: PLEASE REVIEW DOCUMENTATION - ESPECIALLY OUTSTANDING ISSUES AND 
DEVELOPMENT INSTALL GUIDES.

Here you will find working files for the migration of the quiz game to PHP server.

The file tree is set up assuming that the primary location the webserver will direct
to will be the public folder. This will keep the includes folder out of the public
eye. The includes folder will store our php scripts and functions.

To install and run on a local machine (see PharmGenius Development Installation Guide in documentation)
	- You need WAMP/MAMP/LAMP for a local web server.  
	- Copy both the includes folder and public folder to the root directory of your local server  
	- navigate to localhost/public/index.php
